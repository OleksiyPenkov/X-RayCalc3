# X-RayCalc 3

X-ray Calc 3 is a revised and improved version of the software for computer simulation of X-ray reflectivity, including normal incidence and grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry (NIXR and GIXR). Find more information about the previous version here https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352711019303681

In this version, the automatic optimization based on a modified LFPSO algorithm was implemented (see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066334/ and https://journals.iucr.org/j/issues/2024/02/00/te5127/index.html for further details).

The X-Ray Calc distribution contains several demonstration projects located in the Examples folder. To see the demos, click the Open button, navigate to the Examples folder, and select a project file.

**Pre-built package with x86 and x64 executables for Windows and Henke tables (_X-Ray_Calc_3.zip_):**
